# Eli's Pastry Cafe Website

This is the official repository for Eli's Pastry Café. I originally made this site for my mom who had opened up a coffee shop in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Due to unfortunate circumstances, the establishment has since shut down; only the website design and social media platforms remain.

## Background Information

Originally, the space was a barbershop for many years until my mom and I gathered our savings, renoved it ourselves, and opened up shop. Though the café is no longer operating, this website stands as a testament to our aspirations. It also serves as a portfolio example of the design and development work I did to bring our story online.

## Website Architecture

The website was built using plain vanilla HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is composed of the following pages:

- Home: Overview of Eli's Pastry Café which contains a gallery of the items offered, as well as a preorder form.
- About: Background about the café as well as a cover photo of the interior
- Menu: A description of the available pastries, coffees, and drinks
- Order: An order page that allows users to add items to their cart in order to order pickup
- Contact: Location, hours, ways to get in touch via social media and email, and a cover photo of the exterior.
